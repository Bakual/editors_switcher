# Joomla Plugin Editors Switcher

This Joomla Plugin allows to dynamically change the active editor in the Joomla CMS.

To use, install the zipfile and set the "Editors - Switcher" as your editor.

This is a fork of the [Editor Switcher](http://www.joomler.net/download/140-joomla16-plugin/979-editor-switcher-for-joomla-25x-and-30-released.html) originally done by Yoshiki Kozaki.
